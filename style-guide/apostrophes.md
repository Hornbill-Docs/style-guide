<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use an apostrophe in only some plural and possessive forms.

## Apostrophes in plurals

Most plural forms do not require an apostrophe. For example, form the plural of words, abbreviations, and numbers by adding the letter *s* alone.

Use an apostrophe and the letter *s ('s)* to form the plural of single letters.
