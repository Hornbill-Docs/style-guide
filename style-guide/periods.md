# Periods

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use periods correctly.

## Periods in running text

Use a period at the end of a sentence to indicate its conclusion. Follow the period with the default spacing provided by your authoring tool. If you are manually inserting spaces, ensure that only one space is placed after the period.

## Periods with abbreviations

Follow these guidelines for using periods in abbreviations:

- Omit periods in uppercase abbreviations.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - I.D.
    - P.S.T.
    - U.S.A.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - ID
    - PST
    - USA

- Include periods in lowercase abbreviations that relate to time, or that can be confused with words.

  **Examples**
    - mo.
    - hr.
    - min.
    - p.m.
    - no.

- Omit periods in abbreviations for units of measure unless they can be confused with words.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - H.z.
    - m.p.h.
    - T.B.
    - in

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - Hz
    - mph
    - TB
    - in.

- Omit periods in abbreviations for academic degrees.

  **Examples**
    - MBA
    - MD
    - MSc

- Include periods in abbreviations for social titles.

  **Examples**
    - Mr.
    - Sr.
    - Lt.
    - Prof.

- If an abbreviation that requires a period occurs at the end of a sentence, do not include another period.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - The virtual conference starts at 11:00 a.m..

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - The virtual conference starts at 11:00 a.m.

## Periods with file name extensions

Place a period before a file name extension. When referring to such an extension, like `.txt`, treat the period as *dot* and precede it with the indefinite article *a*.

**Example**
- Import your notes in a `.txt` file.

## Periods in headings and titles

Do not end a heading with a period.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
  - Writing SQL queries.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
  - Writing SQL queries

In books, use a period in titles for chapters and appendixes. Insert the period after the name of the entity and the identifying number or letter before the descriptive name.

**Examples**
  - Chapter 1. Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
  - Appendix A. Supplementary data analysis
  - Appendix B. List of interview participants

## Periods after introductory text

Use a period or colon after the introduction to a figure or table.

**Examples**
- The table lists the key performance indicators for analysis:
- The following diagram illustrates the network, its components, and their interconnections.

Use a period after the introduction to a vertical list, including a procedure or substeps in a procedure, when a sentence intervenes between the introduction and the first item.

**Example (vertical list)**
- Before proceeding with installation, check for the following prerequisites. Ensure that each element is adequately met to guarantee a smooth installation process.
  - System compatibility
  - Required software versions
  - User access permissions

**Example (procedure)**
- To log in to the system, complete the following steps. Ensure you have your user ID, password, and the answer to your secret question.
  - Enter your user ID and password.
  - Answer your secret question.
  - Click **Login**.

**Example (substeps)**
1. Connect the cables. The connectors are color coded.<br>
  a. Connect the keyboard cable to the black keyboard connector.<br>
  b. Connect the monitor cable to the blue keyboard connector.

## Periods with lists

Write lists so that all or none of the items start with complete sentences. If list items comprise only complete sentences, include a period after each sentence.

**Example (complete sentences)**
- The procedure for resetting the router is:
  - Unplug the router from the power source.
  - Wait for at least one minute.
  - Reconnect the router to the power source.
  - Wait for the lights to stabilize before use.

If list items comprise only sentence fragments, do not include any end punctuation.

**Example (fragments)**
- Effective team communication requires:
  - Regular meetings
  - Clear objectives
  - Collaborative tools
  - Constructive feedback

If a list contains list items that start with sentence fragments, and one or more of the fragments are followed by complete sentences, include periods after all sentence fragments and sentences.

**Example**
- The software offers several features:
  - User customization. Users can tailor the interface to their preferences.
  - Data encryption.
  - Cloud synchronization. This ensures that data is backed up and accessible across devices.

## Periods with numbers

Use a period on the line (.) as the decimal separator instead of a raised dot (·) unless using a comma (,) is legally required for the specific country you are writing for.

**Examples (incorrect in most cases) ❌**
- The clearance is 8·8 cm (3.4 in.).
- The item costs $49,99.

**Examples (correct in most cases) ✅**
- The clearance is 8.8 cm (3.4 in.).
- The item costs $49.99.

## Periods with parentheses

If the parenthetical text is not a complete sentence, do not insert a period inside the parentheses.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- The meal options include vegetarian dishes (like salads, soups, and pasta.)

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- The meal options include vegetarian dishes (like salads, soups, and pasta).

If the parenthetical text is a complete sentence, you can either include the parenthetical sentence in the sentence to which it pertains or in parentheses as a separate sentence. If you include the parenthetical sentence in the sentence to which it pertains, do not insert a period inside the parentheses. If the parenthetical text is a separate sentence, insert the period inside the parentheses.

**Examples**
- Lunch will be provided at the meeting (there will be options for various dietary restrictions).
- Lunch will be provided at the meeting. (There will be options for various dietary restrictions.)

## Periods with quotation marks

Generally, position periods within the closing quotation marks. For more detailed information on how to use periods in conjunction with quotation marks, refer to the section titled "[Quotation marks with other punctuation](/style-guide/quotation-marks#quotation-marks-with-other-punctuation)."
