# Anthropomorphism

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Anthropomorphism attributes human-like traits, emotions, intentions, or behaviours to non-human entities, objects, animals, or natural phenomena. It involves interpreting or portraying non-human things in a way that resembles human characteristics. 

Do not attribute human characteristics to inanimate objects incapable of human behaviour and emotions.

As much as possible, focus technical information on users and their actions, not on a product and the actions it serves.

**Examples (avoid a product focus) ❌**  
- The system *expects* users to confirm their preferences before proceeding.
- This menu *enables* you to create diagrams.
- The configuration *expects* the disk to have parity protection.
- The website *permits* you to save your credit card information.

**Examples (prefer a user focus) ✅**  
- Before proceeding, ensure your preferences are confirmed.
- Use this menu to create diagrams.
- Before you configure the disk, ensure that it has parity protection.
- You can save your credit card information on the website.

In cases where you must focus on a product, do not use verbs that humanize objects, such as *ask*, *decide*, *expect*, *say*, *see*, *think*, or *want*. However, inanimate objects such as hardware and software can perform actions, and some verbs are appropriate for people and things. For example, a program can *search* for a text string, or an application can *read* data from a file.

**Examples (anthropomorphic verbs) ❌**  
- The laptop *sees* a new device.
- The application *asks* you for a value.
- The Build Console window *tells* you the compilation results.
- If a connector is disabled, the system *thinks* that the entire channel is disabled.

**Examples (appropriate verbs) ✅**
- The laptop *detects* a new device.
- The application *prompts* you for a value.
- The Build Console window *displays* the compilation results.
- If a connector is disabled, the system *operates* as if the entire channel is disabled.
