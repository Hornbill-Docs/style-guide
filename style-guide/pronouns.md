# Pronouns

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Ensure clarity in pronoun references, refrain from using gender-specific pronouns, and employ suitable relative pronouns according to the context.

## Ambiguous pronoun references

Ensure that the noun to which a pronoun refers is clear. Avoid sentences in which a pronoun can refer to more than one noun or in which a pronoun refers to an unstated noun.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- Back up the files weekly. This is important for several reasons.
- If the field is populated with default text, it does not change.
- Maria told Susan that her report was late.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- Back up the files weekly. This practice is important for several reasons.
- If the field is populated with default text, the text does not change.
- Maria told Susan that Susan's report was late.

## Gender-neutral pronouns

Many terms and titles, such as *customer service representative*, *programmer*, *teacher*, or *administrative assistant*, do not apply exclusively to one gender. Therefore, to make your writing inclusive, avoid using gender-specific pronouns. Do not use *he*, *him*, *himself*, or *his* unless the person you refer to is male, and do not use *she*, *her*, *herself*, or *hers* unless the person you refer to is female.

Use these techniques to avoid gender-specific pronouns:

- Use the imperative mood.  
  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - The employee needs to submit her report by Friday.
    - The writer can improve his skills through deliberate practice.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - Submit the report by Friday's deadline.
    - Enhance skills through deliberate practice.

- Use the second person: *you*, *your*, *yours*, or *yourself*.  
  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - The player can now move his joystick in eight directions.

  **Example (correct) ✅**  
    - You can now move your joystick in eight directions.

- Use plural nouns and plural pronouns: *they*, *their*, *theirs*, *them*, or *themselves*.  
  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - A customer service representative must be trained on the hardware and software she services.

  **Example (correct) ✅**
    - Customer service representatives must be trained on the hardware and software they service.
  

Do not use these techniques to avoid gender-specific pronouns:

- Do not use constructions that combine pronouns.  
  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    |  |  |  |
    |---|---|---|
    | he or she | he/she | (s)he |
    | him or her | him/her | s/he |
    | his or her | his/her |  |
    | his or hers | his/hers |  |

- Do not use a singular noun and a plural pronoun: *they*, *their*, *theirs*, *them*, or *themselves*.  
  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Each employee is expected to clean their work area before they go home.
    - The supervisor praised their team for their excellent performance.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - All employees are expected to clean their work areas before they go home.
    - The supervisor praised the team for its excellent performance.

In examples or scenarios, you can use a person's name and then use a gender-specific pronoun to refer to that name. Vary the use of proper names in documentation. Use names that represent various ethnic backgrounds, genders, and locations.

**Examples ✅**
- Sofia conducted her research diligently. She documented her findings comprehensively.
- Ahmed shared his insights during the meeting. He offered a unique perspective.
- Ling reviewed her code thoroughly. She identified potential optimizations.

## Personal pronouns

Use the pronouns that are appropriate for the person of the verb. In technical information, follow these general guidelines for personal pronouns:
- Avoid the first-person pronouns *I* and *we*, except in these situations:
  - In the question portion of frequently asked questions (FAQs)
  - In articles, white papers, or documents that have listed authors and in which the authors describe their own actions or opinions
- Use the second-person pronoun *you* as much as possible. The subject of an imperative sentence is understood to be *you*.
- Avoid third-person pronouns that are gender-specific.

## Relative pronouns

Do not interchange the words *that*, *which*, and *who*.

- Use *that*, without a comma, to introduce a restrictive clause. A restrictive clause is essential to the meaning of the sentence; if the clause is removed, the meaning of the sentence changes.

  **Example of a restrictive clause**
    - The mobile applications that are natively built using Swift are performant and responsive.

  In the restrictive example, the use of *that* serves to identify a distinct subset of mobile applications, specifically those developed natively using Swift. This specificity narrows the focus to these applications' performance and responsiveness characteristics.

- Use *which*, preceded by a comma, to introduce a nonrestrictive clause. A nonrestrictive clause is parenthetical to the meaning of the sentence; if the clause is removed, the essential meaning of the sentence does not change.

  **Example of a nonrestrictive clause**
    - The mobile applications, which are natively built using Swift, are performant and responsive.

  In this nonrestrictive example, *which* only provides additional information about the mobile applications without restricting or specifying a particular subset. The clause is nonessential and only adds descriptive details rather than defining a specific group of applications.

- Use *who*, not *that* or *which*, to refer to a person. However, you can use the possessive form *whose* with both animate and inanimate objects.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - The software engineer that designed the system is experienced.
    - The scientist, which won the award, is giving a presentation.
    - Identify the environment variables that are dynamically set during runtime.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - The software engineer who designed the system is experienced.
    - The scientist, who won the award, is giving a presentation.
    - Identify the environment variables whose values are dynamically set during runtime.
