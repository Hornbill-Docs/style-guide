# Ellipses

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

An ellipsis comprises three consecutive periods. It signifies the exclusion of a portion of a sentence, paragraph, or more extensive text where the omission does not impact the comprehension of the subject under discussion.

Refrain from employing ellipses within running text. If you do utilize an ellipsis, ensure correct spacing is applied.

## Ellipses in running text

Avoid using ellipses in technical content to ensure clarity and maintain a professional tone. Prioritize important information and exclude extraneous details whenever possible.

**Exception for marketing content:** An ellipsis to show a pause is acceptable in some marketing content.

## Ellipses in examples and quotations

In examples or quotations, ellipses can be used to condense information without presenting the entire text. However, avoid using ellipses at the beginning or end of direct quotations. Always start and end quotations with words, even if the text is shortened.

**Examples**
- Use *tap* for mobile devices and use *click* for personal computers, as in the following examples:
  - Click **Open Recent** to ...
  - Tap **Airplane Mode** to ...
- The motivational speaker emphasized, "The key to success ... lies in perseverance."

## Ellipses in user interfaces

In a user interface, an ellipsis typically signifies the need for further user input to execute an action. When describing a user interface, refrain from incorporating ellipses from interface element labels unless one of the following conditions applies:
- The omission of the ellipsis causes confusion.
- You use a tool that extracts the wording from the label, including any punctuation, for use in the documentation.

**Example (incorrect in most cases)**
- Click **Open...** and select a file in the file dialog box.

**Example (correct in most cases)**
- Click **Open** and select a file in the file dialog box.

## Spacing and punctuation with ellipses

For ellipses in user interfaces, apply the spacing that the interface design guidelines for the product specify, or be consistent with existing instances in the interface.

For ellipses in text, some authoring tools provide an ellipsis symbol with default spacing between the periods. If you do not use a symbol and type an ellipsis, do not insert spaces between the periods in the ellipsis.

For both ellipsis symbols and typed ellipses in text, follow these spacing guidelines:

- Insert one space before the ellipsis.
- Insert one space after the ellipsis unless a punctuation mark follows the ellipsis. In that case, do not insert a space between them.
- Keep all the periods in an ellipsis together on one line.

**Examples**
- Incorporate a comma after introductory words, clauses, or phrases in most cases, demonstrated as follows:
  - When creating a diagram, ...
  - Generally speaking, ...
- The artist asserted, "The essence of creativity is to bring into existence something ... that did not exist before."
