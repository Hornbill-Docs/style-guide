# Example data

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

When crafting documentation, using fictitious examples rather than actual data is crucial to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) or the implication of real-world entities. Avoid using real people's names, email addresses, domain names, and other sensitive data. Instead, use generic placeholders like `USER_ID` or `EMAIL_ADDRESS` or invent examples to ensure clarity and maintain privacy. This approach safeguards against privacy concerns and supports the integrity of the documentation.

Maintain consistency in using example data within individual documents or related documentation sets. This approach ensures that when a specific example, such as *WebDevelopment* or *John Doe*, is introduced, it is used consistently throughout a particular document or series of documents on a related topic. Such consistency reinforces understanding and prevents reader confusion, allowing for a more intuitive and cohesive learning experience. Ensuring that examples remain consistent where they are directly relevant helps to create a more structured and logical narrative.

In the same manner, if there is a need to incorporate screen captures in documentation, ensure consistency also between the example data in the written text and that shown in the associated images. This alignment prevents confusion and maintains a seamless narrative. For instance, if *John Doe* is mentioned in the text, it should similarly appear within the screen captures. Such consistency aids comprehension and reinforces the material, ensuring a cohesive instructional experience.

While the names provided were selected to be generic but diverse and inclusive, given the diversity and commonality of names worldwide, some of the names could still correspond to real individuals. It is challenging to guarantee that any name is purely fictional or will not match a real person somewhere in the world, especially with common names.

For documentation or any public-facing material where absolute fictional representation is critical, consider the following approaches to ensure names are perceived as clearly fictional or generic:

- Combine names creatively based on the provided list. Mix the first and last names less likely to be associated with an actual individual. For example, you can use *Mei Patel* for an Asian name or *Casey Johnson* for a North American name. *Mei Patel* is the result of mixing the names Mei Wong and Aarav Patel, while *Casey Johnson* is based on the names Casey Lee and Emily Johnson.

  If this approach is followed, update the provided list of example person names with the inclusion of the newly mixed name.

- Opt to use initials for surnames along with the first name. This approach helps maintain privacy while still allowing for clear identification. For example, use *Mei P.* or *Casey J.* instead of their spelled-out versions.

- Use full initials or generic titles. In cases where specific names are unnecessary, using initials such as *M.P.* or *C.J.* or generic titles like *User 1* or *Participant A* can avoid the issue altogether.

- Where practical, add disclaimers. State that any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is coincidental.

  Specify where such disclaimers could be most effectively placed. For example, you can put it at the beginning of documents or alongside the use of example names.

It is always good practice to use names sensitively, especially in globally accessible content, to respect privacy and avoid unintended implications. If you are particularly concerned about privacy or potential real-life matches, opting for the latter strategies might be the safest approach.

## Example email addresses
<!-- Heading linking is not supported or does not work properly when using the hdocbook tool. Potential links to headings are wrapped in double quotation marks here. -->
When a generic email address is required, use one of the domains specified in the "Example domain names" section combined with one of the names from the "Example person names" section. For instance, `mei.wong@example.com` serves as an appropriate example. Employing generic addresses such as `support@example.net` is acceptable. Avoid using personal names, product names, or fabricated names in email addresses.

## Example company names

When incorporating a company name in examples within your documentation, use *Sample Corporation* as the standard reference. You may introduce descriptive modifiers to the company names to distinguish between two fictional entities. For instance, *Innovative Sample Corporation* can illustrate a company focused on innovation, while *Eco-Friendly Sample Corporation* can represent a company dedicated to environmental sustainability.

## Example phone numbers

In using example phone numbers in documentation, it is essential to use numbers reserved explicitly for such purposes to avoid referencing actual phone numbers that could belong to individuals or businesses. Various countries have different ranges of numbers designated for fictional use in movies, books, and documentation to ensure they do not result in unwanted calls to real people.

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has set aside specific number ranges for entertainment and documentation, primarily in the (555) area code. Specifically, numbers like (555) 0100 through (555) 0199 are reserved for fictional use.

**Example**: (555) 0188

Similarly, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) has set aside specific number ranges for fictional use in the UK. For general purposes, use numbers within the (01632) range (no area), followed by any six-digit number from 960000 to 960999.

**Example**: (01632) 960008

Alternatively, use a placeholder format to represent phone numbers without specifying an actual number, such as the following:
- +1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX for North American context
- +44 (XXXX) XXX-XXXX for UK

This approach maintains privacy and avoids confusion, clearly indicating that the numbers are illustrative.

Keep these guidelines in mind when providing phone numbers as example data:

- Do not use actual phone numbers, as this could lead to privacy violations or unintentional inconvenience to the number's owner.
- Stick to using the phone number ranges reserved for fictional use when you must include phone numbers in your documentation or examples.
- Be mindful of the country-specific reserved ranges, mainly if your documentation targets a global audience. Tailor your example numbers to match the referenced country's format and conventions.

## Example street addresses

Do not use real street addresses unless they are publicly associated with the entity being discussed (such as a company's publicly listed address). Using real addresses without permission could infringe on privacy or lead to unintended consequences. Rather, opt for these fictional street addresses:

- 1020 Developer Drive<br>
  Techville, CA 94088, USA

- 33 Codebase Crescent<br>
  Innovate City, EC1A 1BB<br>
  United Kingdom

- Calle Innovación 58<br>
  28001 Madrid<br>
  España

## Example domain names

Use the following domain names when you need one in an example. They are provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for use in documentation or educational purposes, ensuring they do not lead to active websites owned by individuals or businesses.

- `.example`
- `.test`
- `.localhost`
- `.invalid`

Additionally, the following second-level domain names are often used in examples and are recognized widely for such purposes:

- **`example.com`**
- **`example.net`**
- **`example.org`**

These domain names are guaranteed not to be used for real websites, making them safe for inclusion in any documentation, presentations, or testing environments.

Keep these guidelines in mind when using example domain names:

- Stick to the domains specifically reserved for examples when illustrating concepts that involve web addresses or internet connectivity.
- When using these example domains, briefly explain that they are reserved for examples to avoid confusion for readers unfamiliar with this convention.
- As with other example data, consistently use example domains throughout your documentation. Utilizing the exact example domains can help keep your documentation coherent and understandable.
- Unless it is necessary to reference an actual website for educational or illustrative purposes (and it is done so with caution), always use these example domains to prevent unintentionally directing users to unintended websites.

## Example IP addresses

Whenever an IPv4 address is required for illustrative purposes, such as within a log file, use addresses designated by [RFC 5737](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737) for documentation use:

- `192.0.2.0` to `192.0.2.255`
- `198.51.100.0` to `198.51.100.255`
- `203.0.113.0` to `203.0.113.255`

For specifying IPv4 address ranges, refer to the examples below:

- `192.0.2.0/24`
- `198.51.100.0/24`
- `203.0.113.0/24`

For IPv6 addresses, select values from the range specified in [RFC 3849](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849). The following are examples of IPv6 addresses you can use:

- `2001:db8::`
- `2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`
- `2001:db8:1:1:1:1:1:1`
- `2001:db8:2:2:2:2:2:2`
- `2001:db8:3:3:3:3:3:3`
- `2001:db8:4:4:4:4:4:4`

For specifying IPv6 address ranges, refer to the examples below:

- `2001:db8::/32`

## Example project names

In using example project names in documentation, craft meaningful and descriptive names directly reflecting the project's nature or function. These names should resonate with the user's environment, steering clear of ambiguous terms such as *foo*, *bar*, or *baz* which offer little context or clarity.

Should the documentation scenario require differentiation between similar projects or environments, adopt an appended numbering scheme to distinguish them clearly. For instance, use *Testing*, *Development*, *WebDevelopment-1*, along with *Production-1* and *Production-2* to systematically organize and present project variations. This strategy ensures that examples remain relatable and understandable, directly contributing to the efficacy of the documentation.
