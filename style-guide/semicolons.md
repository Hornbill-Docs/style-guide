# Semicolons

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use a semicolon to delineate independent clauses or elements in a series containing internal punctuation. If a sentence is lengthy, complex, or longer than 25 words, consider rewriting it, dividing it into multiple sentences, or arranging its contents in a vertical list for enhanced readability.

## Semicolons between independent clauses

Use a semicolon between independent clauses that lack a coordinating conjunction. Use coordinating conjunctions like *and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*, *so*, and *yet* when the relationship between clauses needs clarification; utilize a semicolon when the relationship is evident.

**Examples**
- The application functions smoothly with a minimal lag; this indicates the efficiency of its resource utilization.
- The system upgrade went smoothly; the team had thoroughly tested each component.

Use a semicolon to link independent clauses joined by a conjunctive adverb or a transitional phrase. Conjunctive adverbs encompass terms like *also*, *besides*, *consequently*, *conversely*, *finally*, *however*, *instead*, *likewise*, *next*, *otherwise*, *similarly*, *specifically*, *still*, *subsequently*, *then*, and *therefore*. Transitional phrases include *at the same time*, *for example*, *in addition*, and *on the contrary*.

**Examples**
- The software update failed to install properly; consequently, the system displayed the error code `0x800F0922`.
- During the compilation process, ensure all dependencies are resolved correctly; otherwise, errors might arise.
- The prototype was impressive; on the contrary, user feedback indicated several usability issues.

## Semicolons between items in a series

Use a semicolon when separating items within a series that comprise internal punctuation.

**Examples**
- The available options include the red, blue, or black pen; the pencil sharpener; or the ruler with the yellow, green, and blue markings.
- The software must be compatible with various operating systems: Windows, which is common in offices; macOS, widely used in creative industries; Linux, preferred for development; and mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.
