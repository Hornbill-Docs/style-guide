**Examples (correct, US English spelling) ✅**  
- authorize
- center
- color
- meter
- organization

In cases where specific publications, like marketing materials, are exclusively distributed in regions or countries following an alternate spelling, such as UK English, decide which spelling is appropriate.

For the spelling and definition of non-technical terms, refer to the most recent edition of *Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary* or visit [Merriam-Webster Online](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). When the dictionary presents multiple spellings for a word, typically, the first listed spelling is preferred.

**Note:** The [spelling section of Wikipedia's Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Spelling) incorporates a helpful table showing spelling variations for commonly used words across seven countries.
