# Prepositions

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use prepositions effectively to clarify the relationships between elements in a sentence.

Follow these guidelines for using prepositions:  

- Include prepositions that increase clarity.

    - Unload the file using the ULOAD utility.

  **Example (clear) ✅**
    - Unload the file by using the ULOAD utility.

- Omit unnecessary prepositions. For example, omit the prepositions in phrasal verbs when the verb alone provides the same meaning.  
  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - click on
    - print out
    - start up

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - click
    - print
    - start
