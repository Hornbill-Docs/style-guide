# Exclamation points

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Do not punctuate sentences with exclamation points due to their potential negative interpretations, such as conveying aggression, condescension, excessive informality, or overly informal tone.

Express urgency or emphasis through appropriate word choices rather than relying on exclamation points. Consider using labeled notes to highlight crucial hints, tips, guidance, restrictions, or advice that might be overlooked.
