# Commas

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use a comma to delineate different elements within a sentence, like series items, various clauses, or leading phrases. For sentences exceeding 25 words or those of complex structure, consider restructuring them into shorter sentences, breaking them into multiple sentences, or arranging the information in a vertical list format.

## Commas between clauses

Use a comma between independent clauses separated by a coordinating conjunction unless the clauses are short or closely related. Coordinating conjunctions are *and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*, *so*, and *yet*.

**Examples**
- Click **Open** and select a file.
- The software can streamline processes, so it can significantly increase productivity.
- The team completed the initial analysis, and they are now working on the report.

*Then* is not a coordinating conjunction. You cannot join independent clauses with *then* unless you add a semicolon or a coordinating conjunction.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
  - Click **Print** then select a printer device.
  - Click **Print**, then select a printer device.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
  - Click **Print**; then select a printer device.
  - Click **Print** and then select a printer device.

Do not use a comma between an independent clause and a dependent clause separated by a coordinating conjunction unless the sentence might be misread without a comma.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- The engineer finished the project on time, and exceeded our expectations.
- The speaker greeted the last participant who joined the seminar and started the talk.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- The engineer finished the project on time and exceeded our expectations.
- The speaker greeted the last participant who joined the seminar, and started the talk.

## Commas after introductory words and phrases

Use a comma after most introductory words, clauses, and phrases.

**Examples**
- Consequently, the company decided to increase its research and development budget.
- Before you delete the file, proceed to step 3.
- To open a new browser window, click **File > New Window**.
- Within the application, navigate to the settings menu.
- When handling chemicals, always wear protective gloves.

## Commas between items in a series

Use commas to separate items in a series of three or more. Use a comma before the conjunction that precedes the final item.

**Exception for marketing content:** In marketing content, use a comma before a conjunction only for clarity.

**Examples**
- You can select a hardcover, paperback, or digital format for your book order.
- The tour includes visits to historical landmarks, cultural exhibitions, and local artisan markets.
- The museum offers guided tours, interactive exhibits, nor charges for entry on Sundays.

Do not add commas or conjunctions between the items in a series of special characters.

**Example (incorrect) ❌**
- Valid symbols for the password include the following:<br>`*, %, $, +, and !`.

**Example (correct) ✅**
- Valid symbols for the password include the following:<br>`* % $ + !`.

## Commas with nonrestrictive clauses

Always place a comma before a nonrestrictive clause starting with the word *which*. Avoid using a comma before a restrictive clause that begins with the word *that*.

**Examples**
- The new software, which was released last week, has significantly improved efficiency.
- The new software that was released last week has significantly improved efficiency.
