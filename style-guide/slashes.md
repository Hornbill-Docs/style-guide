# Slashes

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Do not use slashes except in code and the following:

- In a few cases, use a forward slash between words when the slash construction is an industry-standard. Also, do not insert a space before or after a forward slash or backslash.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - client / server
    - input / output

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - client/server
    - I/O
    - input/output
    - publish/subscribe
    - read/write

## Slashes in dates

### And/or

Refrain from using the construction *and/or*, which can cause confusion and problems for translation. Instead, clarify the options using *and* or *or*, or by stating the choices, such as *option A*, *option B*, or *both*.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
  - Connect your printer and/or scanner to the computer.
  - The editor can process raw HTML and/or inline CSS.

**Examples (correct) ✅**

## Slashes in path names and URLs

Follow these guidelines for using slashes in path names and URLs:

- Use forward slashes for URLs.

- For path names, use a forward slash (/) or backslash (\\) according to the operating system convention. For example, the Windows operating system uses backslashes for path names.

  For information that applies to multiple operating systems, be consistent and describe the convention if necessary.

  **Example**  
  The Windows operating system uses a backslash (\\) to delimit directories in a directory path. Linux-based operating systems and URLs use a forward slash (/) as a delimiter. This information uses forward slashes for all delimiters. Depending on your operating system, you might have to enter directory paths differently from what is shown in the examples.

- Do not include a forward slash at the end of a URL.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - www.hornbill.com/

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - www.hornbill.com

- If a long URL does not fit on one line, add a line break immediately after an existing forward slash (/) or double forward slash (//), and continue the URL on the following line. Do not add a hyphen to indicate a break in a URL.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - <p>https://www.hornbill.com/blog/tag-<br>/collaborative-service-management</p>
  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - <p>https://www.hornbill.com/blog/tag/<br>collaborative-service-management</p>

- If a path does not fit on one line, end the first line after an existing forward slash or backslash and continue the path on the next line. Do not add a hyphen to indicate a break in a path.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - <p>C:\Desktop\Communication\Resources\Media\Training-<br> Videos\how-to-speak-effectively.mp4</p>

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - <p>C:\Desktop\Communication\Resources\Media\Training Videos\<br>how-to-speak-effectively.mp4</p>

## Slashes in fractions

Use decimal numerals instead of fractions to represent fractional parts of units whenever possible.

**Examples (avoid) ❌**
  - 8 1/2
  - 1 3/4

**Examples (prefer) ✅**
  - 8.5
  - 1.75

## Slashes in mathematical equations

Use a forward slash (/) as an operational symbol for division. Do not insert a space before or after the forward slash.

**Example**
  - (a + b)/(c + d) = 8

## Slashes in abbreviations

Do not use abbreviations that rely on slashes. Instead, spell the words out.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
  - c/o
  - w/

**Examples (correct) ✅**
  - care of
  - with
