# Quotation marks

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use double quotation marks (") and single quotation marks (') correctly.

## Terminology for quotation marks

When referencing quotation marks in text, be specific about the type: clarify whether you are referring to double quotation marks or single quotation marks. The term *quotation mark* can generically denote either of these characters.

To refer to the position of the characters, use the terms *opening* and *closing*.

**Example**
- Ensure that each set of opening quotation marks has a matching set of closing quotation marks.

Avoid using the term *quotes* when referring to quotation marks or the enclosed text. Use the term *quote* exclusively as a verb and employ *quotation* as the noun.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- Add "confidential" in quotes at the top of the document.
- The speech began with a powerful quote from a historical figure.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- Add the word "confidential" in double quotation marks at the top of the document.
- The speech began with a powerful quotation from a historical figure.

## Quotation marks for emphasis

Avoid using quotation marks to emphasize words or phrases, as they can make the text appear cluttered. For emphasis, italicize the words. If you need to highlight information that might be missed, use a clearly labeled note.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- Remember to "carefully" read the instructions before assembly.
- The term "sustainability" is crucial in this context.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- **Important:** Carefully read the instructions before assembly.
- The term *sustainability* is crucial in this context.

## Double quotation marks

Use double quotation marks for the following items:

- Quotations

  **Examples**
    - During the interview, the author stated, "My writing is heavily influenced by my childhood experiences."
    - The manual advises, "Always disconnect the machine from the power source before attempting any repairs."

- Words that are used in a special sense

  **Examples**
    - In this document, "legacy" systems refer to older technologies still in use.
    - The term "green" in this context refers to environmentally sustainable practices.

  Use double quotation marks for a word that is used in a special sense only if no other word clearly expresses the meaning. Do not overuse quotation marks for this purpose. Using a word in a special sense can cause problems for translation.

- References to topic titles, section titles, chapter titles, or online information

  **Examples**
    - Explore the article "The Future of Renewable Energy" for insights into sustainable power sources.
    - For detailed steps on software installation, see the "Installation Process" chapter in the guidebook.
    - Watch the "Advanced Microsoft Excel Techniques" tutorial video to enhance your spreadsheet skills.

- Names of these items when they have sentence-style capitalization:
  - Notebooks
  - Pages
  - Panes
  - Portals
  - Portlets
  - Windows
  - Wizards

  **Examples**
    - Access the "Employee details" portal for more information.
    - Follow the instructions in the "Data recovery" wizard to restore your files.
    - Use the "Configure settings" portlet to adjust your preferences.

## Single quotation marks

Use single quotation marks for the following items:

- Quotation marks inside double quotation marks

  **Example**
    - The teacher remarked, "It's important to remember what Shakespeare meant when he wrote 'To thine own self be true.'"

- Code example, code syntax, and programming elements that require single quotation marks

  **Examples**
  - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE lastname = 'Smith';`
  - `greeting = 'Hello, World!'`

- Hexadecimal numbers

  **Examples**
  - `X'00'`
  - `X'41'`

## Quotation marks with other punctuation

Typically, position commas and periods within closing quotation marks, while other punctuation marks should be placed outside these marks.

**Examples**
- The document states, "Ensure all data is accurately recorded," before submitting the report.
- The supervisor said, "You need to prepare the requirements for next week's general meeting."

Unless a punctuation mark is part of the syntax, do not place a punctuation mark inside the quotation marks of these items:
- Coding statements
- Symbolic names
- Hexadecimal, binary, or octal values
- Other programming elements that use quotation marks

**Examples**
- In the color setting, ensure the value is `X'1A2B3C'`.
- Use the following code in the calendar application:<br>`months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar"]`

When possible, rewrite the text to move the comma away from the quotation marks of these items.

## Straight and curly quotation marks

Straight quotation marks are generated directly through the keyboard, while curly quotation marks are generated using tagging in an authoring tool. Other tools, such as word processors, automatically convert straight quotation marks to curly versions as you type.

Always use straight quotation marks for the following reasons:

- It makes writing developer documentation easier as code requires straight marks instead of curly versions.
- Humans who manually type curly marks also often make mistakes.
- Manually typing curly marks can be difficult on some platforms.
- It makes reviewing documents easier. It is hard to proofread a document, whether marks are straight or curly, and which direction they point in.

**Example (incorrect) ❌**
- <pre>The book’s title is “The Road Not Taken.”</pre>

- <pre>The book's title is "The Road Not Taken."</pre>
