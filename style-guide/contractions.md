# Contractions

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Do not use contractions in technical information.

Contractions can cause difficulty for translation and for users whose primary language is not English. For example, *it's* can be interpreted as *it is* or *it has*. Contractions can also contribute to an overly informal tone.

The contraction *what's* in the phrase *what's new* is acceptable in content that presents new and changed items between versions of products or information.
