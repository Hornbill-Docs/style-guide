# Abbreviations

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Abbreviations encompass initialisms, acronyms, and shortened words. An initialism refers to an abbreviation pronounced as individual letters, like HTTP. Conversely, an acronym forms a pronounceable word, as seen in SONAR.

## General guidelines

Utilize abbreviations under the following conditions:
- When their meanings are evident.
- If they enhance comprehension.
- When they offer easier recognition than their spelled-out counterparts, for example, CPU.
- In space-constrained settings, such as tables or intricate diagrams.

Refrain from using abbreviations if:
- Their meanings are ambiguous.
- They hinder understanding.
- They appear sporadically within extensive content (e.g., two or three instances in a large body of text).
- They stem from Latin origins.
- They abbreviate Hornbill product names.
- They shorten names or entities owned by other companies not using those abbreviations.
- They might represent a registered trademark for a different product or entity.

Follow these general guidelines for abbreviations:

- Choose the indefinite article *a* or *an* according to how an abbreviation is spoken. Use *a* before an abbreviation that begins with a consonant sound. Use *an* before an abbreviation with a vowel sound.

  **Examples**
    - a PDF document
    - an XML file

  The above example uses the *an* article before the "XML" word. It is because "X" is a consonant but sounds like the vowel "E" when spoken.

- When an abbreviation allows for a plural form, create the plural by appending a lowercase *s*. For units of measurement, the abbreviation remains the same for both singular and plural forms.

  **Examples**
    - record IDs
    - URLs
    - 8 mm
    - 12 mm

- Do not use an abbreviation as a noun unless the sentence makes sense when you substitute the spelled-out form of the term.

  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - The tutorials are available as PDFs. [portable document formats]

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - The tutorials are available as PDF files.
    - The next version of the SDK will support the Ruby programming language.
    - Enhancements in this release include a redesigned GUI.

- Do not use abbreviations as verbs.

  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - You can FTP the files to the server.

  **Example (correct) ✅**
    - You can use the FTP command to send the files to the server.

- Do not use an apostrophe and the letter *s ('s)* to show the possessive form of an abbreviation. Make the abbreviation an adjective, or use it in a prepositional phrase.

  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - HTML's properties are editable.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - HTML properties are editable.
    - The properties of HTML are editable.

## Spelled-out forms of abbreviations

Follow these guidelines for spelling out abbreviations:

- Avoid spelling out commonly recognized abbreviations within the target audience. Commonly known terms vary by audience; each writing and editing team must determine which abbreviations are familiar to the audience.

  **Examples**
    - CSS
    - HTML
    - PDF
    - RAM
    - XML

- If an abbreviation is not commonly known, or if you are unsure whether it is, spell out the term at its first occurrence in the text, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. If the information has a defined, linear reading path, consider spelling out an abbreviation at its first occurrence in a major section, such as at the beginning of each chapter in a book or in an overview topic instead of in each subtopic.

  **Examples**
    - massively parallel processing (MPP)
    - minimum recovery time (MRT)
    - customer service representative (CSR)

- Confirm the capitalization for the spelled-out form of an abbreviation; many spelled-out abbreviations do not require initial uppercase letters.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Local Area Network (LAN)
    - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    - Solid State Drive (SSD)

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - local area network (LAN)
    - service-oriented architecture (SOA)
    - solid state drive (SSD)

- Most spelled-out forms of language and protocol names have initial uppercase letters.

  **Examples**
    - Application Programming Interface (API)
    - Structured Query Language (SQL)
    - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
    - Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

- When you spell out an abbreviation, do not capitalize letters in the middle of a word to show the origin of an initialism.

  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - eXtensible markup language (XML)

  **Example (correct) ✅**
    - Extensible Markup Language (XML)

- Avoid redundancies in spelling out abbreviations. For instance, refrain from using *DASD device* as *D* already stands for *device*, or *JCL language*, because the *L* stands for *language*. Exceptions may exist, such as referencing a *CICS system*, even though *CICS* expands to *Customer Information Control System*.

## Periods with abbreviations

Follow these guidelines for using periods in abbreviations:

- Omit periods in uppercase abbreviations.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - I.D.
    - P.S.T.
    - U.K.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - ID
    - PST
    - UK

- Incorporate periods in lowercase abbreviations that pertain to time or could potentially be mistaken for words.

  **Examples**
    - a.m.
    - p.m.
    - hr.
    - yr.
    - no.

- Exclude periods in measurement unit abbreviations unless their absence might lead to word confusion.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - b.p.s
    - r.p.m
    - in

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - bps
    - rpm
    - in.

- Omit periods in abbreviations for academic degrees.

  **Examples**
    - BA
    - MA
    - PhD

- Incorporate periods in abbreviations for social titles.

  **Examples**
    - Dr.
    - Ms.
    - Jr.

- If an abbreviation that requires a period occurs at the end of the sentence, do not include another period.

  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - The conference starts at 1:00 p.m..

  **Example (correct) ✅**
    - The conference starts at 1:00 p.m.

## Abbreviations not to use

Keep in mind the following guidelines on what abbreviations to avoid:

- Do not use Latin abbreviations; use their English equivalents instead. Latin abbreviations are sometimes misunderstood.

  | Latin abbreviation | English<br>equivalent |
  |---|---|
  | e.g. | Use *for example*.|
  | etc. | Use *and so on* when you list a clear sequence of elements, such as "1, 2, 3, and so on" or "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on." Otherwise, rewrite the sentence to replace *etc.* with something more descriptive, such as "and other output."|
  | i.e. | Use *that is*. |

- Do not use internet slang abbreviations like *RTFM*, *tl;dr*, *[ymmv](/style-guide/terminology-reference#ymmv)*, and similar ones. Instead, express the intended meaning in a more descriptive manner.

- Prefer the most widely used form of a word. If the complete word is frequently used and straightforward, use it rather than abbreviating. For instance, utilize *approximately* instead of *approx*.

- Spell out shortened words or common symbols that are substitutions for words.

  **Example (incorrect) ❌**
    - Adding indexes to the `customers` table increased search performance by 12x.

  **Example (correct) ✅**
    - Adding indexes to the `customers` table increased search performance by 12 times.

## Abbreviations in headings and titles

Only use abbreviations in headings and titles if an abbreviation is well-known or the spelled-out form is too long. If you use an abbreviation for the first time in a heading or title, ensure that you include the spelled-out form either in the heading or title or in the text that immediately follows the heading or title.

**Examples**
- **Creating Unified Modeling Language diagrams**  
  You can use Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to model complex systems.

- **Creating UML diagrams**  
  You can use Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to model complex systems.

- **Creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams**  
  You can use UML diagrams to model complex systems.

## Abbreviations in glossaries

For the abbreviation, use a cross-reference labeled *See* that directs to the spelled-out term; do not provide a definition.

**Example**
  - **DBCS**  
  See <u>double-byte character set</u>.

When using the spelled-out term, provide a definition without a *See* reference to the abbreviation. Include the abbreviated term in parentheses after the spelled-out term.

**Example**
- **double-byte character set (DBCS)**  
A set of characters in which each character is represented by 2 bytes. These character sets are ...

## Abbreviations for units of time

Limit the use of abbreviated time units, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years, within the main body of text. Abbreviate time units primarily for situations with space constraints, such as tables or intricate diagrams. When you must abbreviate units of time, use these abbreviations for singular and plural forms and insert a period after them: sec., min., hr., d., mo., and yr.
