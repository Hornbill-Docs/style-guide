# Abbreviations

Abbreviations encompass initialisms, acronyms, and shortened words. An initialism refers to an abbreviation pronounced as individual letters, like HTTP. Conversely, an acronym forms a pronounceable word, as seen in SONAR.

## General guidelines

Utilize abbreviations under the following conditions:
- When their meanings are evident.
- If they enhance comprehension.
- When they offer easier recognition than their spelled-out counterparts (e.g., CPU).
- In space-constrained settings, such as tables or intricate diagrams.

Refrain from using abbreviations if:
- Their meanings are ambiguous.
- They hinder understanding.
- They appear sporadically within extensive content (e.g., two or three instances in a large body of text).
- They stem from Latin origins.
- They abbreviate Hornbill product names.
- They shorten names or entities owned by other companies not using those abbreviations.
- They might represent a registered trademark for a different product or entity.

Follow these general guidelines for abbreviations:

- Choose the indefinite article *a* or *an* according to how an abbreviation is spoken. Use *a* before an abbreviation that begins with a consonant sound. Use *an* before an abbreviation with a vowel sound.

  Examples
  a PDF document
  an XML file

  The above example uses the *an* article before the "XML" word. It is because "X" is a consonant but sounds like the vowel "E" when spoken.

- When an abbreviation allows for a plural form, create the plural by appending a lowercase *s*. For units of measurement, the abbreviation remains the same for both singular and plural forms.

  Examples  
  record IDs  
  URLs  
  8 mm  
  12 mm  

- Do not use an abbreviation as a noun unless the sentence makes sense when you substitute the spelled-out form of the term.
