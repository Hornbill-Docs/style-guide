# Pluralize a single letter

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

To pluralize a single letter, italicize the letter, then append an apostrophe and an unitalicized letter *s*.

**Examples**

- Before the repair, the printer did not print uppercase *A*'s or lowercase *t*'s.
- Beginner typists often mistype 9s, *P*s, and *Z*s.
