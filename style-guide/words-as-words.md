# Words as words

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

When indicating a specific word or phrase for emphasis or clarification within your text, mainly to denote the word or phrase as an object of discussion, italicize it rather than using quotation marks or bold formatting.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- In academic writing, differentiate between the use of <u>who</u> for people and <u>that</u> for objects or animals.
- Avoid using the slash symbol (/) in formal writing; instead, opt for words like **or** to clarify alternatives.
