# Hyphens

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use hyphens to enhance clarity by linking associated information. Utilize hyphens within compound adjectives to specify words modifying another term, and use hyphens in conjunction with numbers to denote their connection to measurements, words, or other numerical figures.

## Hyphens with prefixes and suffixes

Avoid using hyphens to connect prefixes or suffixes to words in most instances. Typically, a hyphen is unnecessary if the word remains easily readable without it.

Refer to *Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary* for guidance on hyphenating prefixes. If the dictionary lacks a specific word or precedent, follow the hyphenation guidelines outlined in *The Chicago Manual of Style*. Both references endorse a closed style for prefixes, preferring the omission of hyphens where feasible.

Hyphenate a prefix primarily to prevent misinterpretation or ambiguity. Specifically, hyphenate a prefix in the following instances:

- When *Merriam-Webster* uses a hyphen (for example, *bi-level*, *co-edition*)
- When you must distinguish the word from a homonym (for example, *co-op*, *re-cover*, *re-create*, *re-sign*)
- When the root word is capitalized or a numeral (for example, *pre-2000*)
- When the root word consists of more than one word (for example, *non-English-speaking citizens*, *pre-latency-period transaction*)
- In some words in which identical letters would be next to each other (for example, *anti-intellectual*, *bell-like*, *co-opt*, *de-emphasize*)
- When the prefix is *self-*, *all-*, or *ex-* (meaning formerly)

The following table lists common prefixes and examples of when to omit or use a hyphen:

## Hyphens with compound words

To clarify which noun is being modified, avoid long compound phrases and noun strings, and use hyphens when appropriate. Consider using a prepositional phrase after a noun instead of a compound adjective.

When you write compound phrases, use hyphens to avoid ambiguity, but do not use hyphens unnecessarily. Follow these guidelines:

- Hyphenate compound adjectives and adverbs before a noun if readers might misinterpret the term or phrase.

  **Examples (ambiguous)**
    - high-speed internet connection
    - three dimensional movie
    - user friendly interface

  **Examples (clear)**
    - high-speed internet connection
    - three-dimensional movie (to indicate that it is a movie in three dimensions)
    - user-friendly interface

- Do not use a hyphen after an adverb or adjective that ends in *-ly* because such terms are never ambiguous.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - easily-understood instructions
    - nicely-formatted document
    - openly-discussed topic

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - easily understood instructions
    - nicely formatted document
    - openly discussed topic

- In most cases, when a compound adjective follows a noun, do not hyphenate it. In some cases, a hyphen is necessary to avoid ambiguity.

  **Examples**
    - The concept appears highly feasible.
    - The boss' speech was refreshingly honest.
    - The issue is thought provoking. (The issue is thought of as provoking.)
    - The issue is thought-provoking. (The issue provokes thoughts.)

- Hyphenate all the words that function as the compound adjective before the noun.

  **Examples**
    - last-minute solution
    - well-thought-out plan

- Hyphenate the prefix to a hyphenated compound.

  **Examples**
    - anti-child-labor policy
    - non-smoking-friendly environment
    - pre-self-driving car technology

- When hyphenated compounds in a series have the same first word or last word, repeat the common word. Omitting words makes translation more difficult and slows comprehension.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - The data is stored in on-premises, -cloud, and -hybrid environments.
    - The platform supports multi-, single-, and guest-user access levels.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - The data is stored in on-premises, on-cloud, and on-hybrid environments.
    - The platform supports multi-user, single-user, and guest-user access levels.

## Hyphens and capitalization

Follow these capitalization guidelines for hyphenated words:

- When a hyphenated word is found at the start of a sentence, capitalize solely the initial element within the term unless any subsequent element qualifies as a proper noun or proper adjective.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - one
    - two

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - one
    - two

- When a hyphenated word appears at the beginning of a heading utilizing sentence-style capitalization, capitalize solely the initial element within the term unless any subsequent element is a proper noun or proper adjective.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Cloud-Based applications
    - Data-Driven analytics
    - Non-Asian-Based companies

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - Cloud-based applications
    - Data-driven analytics
    - Non-Asian-based companies

- When a hyphenated word appears in a heading styled with headline capitalization, capitalize the first and last elements of hyphenated words, regardless of their part of speech. Additionally, capitalize any element within the hyphenated word that is not an article, preposition, or coordinating conjunction.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - High-quality Data Analysis
    - Real-time Performance Monitoring
    - State-of-the-art Technology Solutions

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - High-Quality Data Analysis
    - Real-Time Performance Monitoring
    - State-of-the-Art Technology Solutions

## Hyphens with numbers

Use hyphens in some spelled-out numbers and in some number compounds. See "[Numbers](style-guide/numbers)" for more details about using hyphens with numbers.

## Hyphens with ranges

Follow these guidelines for using hyphens with ranges:

- Use a hyphen to show a range of items, such as numbers, letters, pages, dates, or codes. Insert a space before and after the hyphen.

  **Examples**
    - January - April
    - numbers 10 - 20
    - pages 80 - 88

- Do not use words such as *from* or *between* to show a range; it is not clear whether the items are the boundaries of the range or are included in the range.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - letters from H - M
    - records between HM200 and HM208

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - letters H - M
    - records HM200 - HM208

- If a number range is part of a compound adjective, hyphenate only the number and unit. You can omit the unit from the first compound in a number range.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - a 1-character-through-8-character field
    - a 1-through-8-character field
    - The system supports a 30-to-40-user capacity.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - a 1-character through 8-character field
    - a 1- through 8-character field
    - The system supports a 30- to 40-user capacity.

See "[Ranges of numbers](style-guide/numbers#ranges-of-numbers)" for details on how to show a range of measurements.
