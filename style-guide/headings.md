# Headings

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use headings to structure information coherently and logically.

## Format of headings

Consistently and logically format your headings:

- Avoid numbering headings except for chapter titles in books and topic-based content. However, it's acceptable to number headings and subheadings in shorter documents such as articles, white papers, quick start guides, and similar publications.
- Ensure uniform typographic styling for headings of the same level throughout your publication. Use the formatting features of your writing tool to maintain this consistency.
- Refrain from positioning headings consecutively without intervening text. If the text between headings is minimal, reassess the necessity of one of the headings and restructure the content if needed.

## Wording of headings

Craft headings to be concise and informative, choosing the right style for different types of information:

- Use gerunds (verbs ending in -ing) for task-related headings. For subjects that provide a general overview or introduction, opt for headings like *Introduction* or *Overview*, instead of starting with terms like *Understanding*, *Introducing*, or *Learning*.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Understanding cloud computing
    - Upgrade software components

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - Introduction to cloud computing
    - Upgrading software components

- Use nouns or noun phrases for headings of concepts or reference information.

  **Examples**
    - Fundamentals of web development
    - Code refactoring techniques

- Use the singular form if a heading is clearly about a singular item. Use the plural form if the item can be either singular or plural.

  **Examples**
    - Configuring the router
    - Setting up network connections

- Use question-style headings like "How do I subscribe to updates?" exclusively in troubleshooting sections and frequently asked questions (FAQs). Refrain from using such headings in conceptual, task-oriented, or reference material.

  **Exception for marketing content:** Using questions as headings in marketing documents may sometimes be permissible.

## Punctuation with headings

Use appropriate punctuation in headings:

- Do not end a heading with a period or colon.
- Use a colon to separate a heading from its subheading, avoiding using parentheses or dashes. Place the colon immediately after the heading, followed by a single space, and ensure the subheading's first letter is capitalized.

  **Examples**
    - Data Encryption Techniques: Securing Digital Information
    - Dietary preferences: By age group and lifestyle

- In books, use a period in titles for chapters and appendixes. Insert the period after the name of the entity and the identifying number or letter before the descriptive name.

  **Examples**
    - Chapter 2. Advanced Database Management Systems
    - Appendix A. User manual guidelines
    - Appendix B. Code sample repository

## Abbreviations in headings

Limit the use of abbreviations in headings to those that are widely recognized or when the complete term is excessively lengthy. When introducing an abbreviation in a heading for the first time, make sure to provide its full form either within the heading itself or in the subsequent text immediately following the heading.

**Examples**

- **Integrating Application Programming Interface tools**<br>
  Application Programming Interface (API) tools facilitate efficient communication between software programs.

- **Integrating API tools**<br>
  Application Programming Interface (API) tools facilitate efficient communication between software programs.

- **Integrating Application Programming Interface (API) tools**<br>
