# Working with Numbers
Numbers play very important role in our lives. We use numbers in date, time, year in our daily lives like school and work, counting money, measurements, phone numbers, password on our phone locks, reading, page numbers, and TV channels. 
So, we should be consistent in the use of numbers throughout our content. Here are some recommended guidelines which you should follow.
## Usage of Commas
* Use commas in numbers having four or more digits.  
    Examples:  
    $ 8,332  
    € 10,237  
    1,024 MB  
    Exception: Whenever assigning years, pixels, or baud, use commas only when the number has five or more digits.  
    Examples:  
    9600 B.C.  
    12,220 x 1420 pixels  
    28,796 baud
* Do not use commas when providing page numbers or address details.  
    Examples:  
    Page 2556  
    26712 SE 51st Street
* Do not use commas after the decimal points in decimal fractions.  
    Examples:  
    2.17488 units
## Words vs. Numerals
* Numbers from zero through nine should be spelled out in the body text.  
    Use numerals from 10 or greater. These are recommended guidelines however it depends on space availability in the UI on the page  
    Examples:  
    seven televisions  
    15 Laptops  
    zero probability 
* For units of time, spell out zero through to nine and use numeral for 10 or greater.  
    Examples:  
    48 hours  
    five days  
    12 years
* Use either words or numerals across the content, for any kind of item or other items of that type.  
    Examples:  
    First season has 9 episodes, second season has 10 episodes and third season has 15 episodes.
    Competition finale is one month and 15 days away.
* If two items appear together that refer different things, use numerals for one and spell out the other.  
    Examples:  
    Three seasons of around 39 episodes
* It is recommended to not start a sentence with numerals. Try rewriting a sentence using modifier for the number.  
    Examples:  
    More than fifteen benefits are available instead of Fifteen benefits are available.  
    Taller than 6 feet instead of 6 feet Tall
* Use numerals in following situations:

    |Use numerals for|Examples|
    |:---|:---|
    |Temperature, volume, size, weight, pixels, measurements of distance, points – Even when the number is less than 10.|5 feet, 10 inches <br>1024 x 1024 pixels <br>1.25 kgs <br>10 meters|
    |A number when an end user is asked to enter.|Enter **8**|
    |A round number of 1 million or more.|2 million|
    |Include AM or PM for time of the day.<br>Exception: Use noon or midnight instead of 12:00. Include time zone details in case discussion involve individuals out of local time zone.|05:50 AM <br>11:30 PM <br>The show starts at noon. <br>The meeting starts at 02:00 PM Eastern Time.|
    |For dimensions of tiles, papers size, screen resolutions use the multiplication sign (x), having a space before and after it.|10” x 12” area <br>8 x 8 tile|
    |Use numeral with keyword percent to specify a percentage. <br>If defined quantity is not mentioned then use keyword percentage.|More than 80 percent of employees completed the training. <br> Only 2 percent of the crowd could guess the winner. <br>A large percentage of players should be present.|
    |Numbered sections of documents and coordinates of tables or worksheets.|Chapter 11 <br>Section 6 <br>Row 5, column 7|
    
## Dates
* For dates, do not use ordinal numbers. Instead of May fifth or March tenth, use May 5 or March 5.
* Since position of month can vary from country to country, it is recommended is to always spell out name of the month.
    For example: 07/02/2023 can be February 7, 2023 or July 2, 2023.
## Phone Numbers  
* Do not use periods, space, parentheses, or anything else, apart from hyphens, as a space delimiter for phone numbers.
    For example: 624-666-2341
* Local phone number style and formatting can differ for phone numbers in different regions.
## Negative Numbers 
* Use hyphen to display negative number.  
    Example: –99
## Compound Numbers
* Use hyphen while spelling out compound numbers.  
    Examples:  
    The twenty-fifth anniversary  
    Ninety-nine runs
## Ordinal Numbers 
* Always spell out ordinal numbers.  
    Examples:  
    The tenth row  
    The sixtieth birthday
* Do not add suffix -ly to an ordinal number. For example, firstly or secondly.
## Number Ranges
* Use from and through to describe a range of numbers.
* Exceptions  
    Use en dash in a range of pages.  
    Use to in a range of times.
* Do not use from in case en dash is used to show a range.  
    Examples:  
    From 25 through 50  
    Pages 110-150  
    06:00 AM to 07:30 AM
## Decimals and Fractions
* For decimal fractions less than one, add a zero before the decimal point.  
Example: 0.25
* It is not necessary to add a zero before decimal point, in case the end user is asked to enter a value.  
Example: Enter **.99”**
* When measurement units are spelled out, always use plural  if the quantity is in a decimal format. Use singular format when quantity is 1.  
    Examples:  
    0 inches  
    0.75 centimeters  
    1 meter
* Fractions can be expressed in words, as symbols, or as decimals.
* Use hyphen to connect numerator and denominator for spelled-out fractions.  
    Examples:  
    one-third of the syllabus  
    three-forth portion
* Do not use numerals separated by a slash to express fractions.  
    Exception: A slash can be used between the numerator and denominator if an equation occurs in the text.  
    Example:  
    3/4 + 1/4 = 1
## Abbreviations 
* Avoid using abbreviations while expressing numbers. Do not abbreviate hundred, thousand, million, and billion as H, K, M, B instead use the entire number.  
Examples:  
Winner will get $50 million  
Factory has more than 10,000 people
* If you have to use abbreviations, the following guidelines must be followed:
    * Capitalize H, K, M, and B
    * No space between the number and the abbreviation
