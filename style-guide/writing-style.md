# Writing Style

Writing style refers to the way a writer conveys their thoughts, ideas, and messages in written form. It is the unique combination of word choice, sentence structure, tone, and voice that distinguishes one writer from another. Writing style plays an important role in making the content engaging, persuasive, or informative, depending on the intended purpose and audience.

There are several different writing styles, and each serves a specific purpose:

- __Descriptive__: This style aims to paint a vivid picture for the reader by using rich, sensory details and language. It is often employed in fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction.

- __Narrative__: This style tells a story, typically involving characters, events, and a plot. It is most commonly used in novels, short stories, and biographies.

- __Expository__: This style aims to inform or explain a topic in a clear, straightforward manner. It is often used in academic writing, news articles, and how-to guides.

- __Persuasive__: This style is intended to convince the reader of a specific viewpoint or argument. It is commonly found in opinion pieces, editorials, and advertisements.

- __Conversational__: This style imitates casual, spoken language and often includes contractions, colloquialisms, and a friendly tone. It is frequently used in blog posts, social media content, and informal business communications.

- __Technical__: This style is used to convey complex, specialized information in a clear, concise manner. It is typically employed in user manuals, scientific articles, and other technical documents.

- __Formal__: This style adheres to strict grammatical rules and avoids colloquial language, contractions, and informal tone. It is often used in academic writing, legal documents, and formal business communications.

- __Informal__: This style is more relaxed and uses casual language, contractions, and a conversational tone. It is suitable for blog posts, personal correspondence, and other casual contexts.

Choosing the appropriate writing style for Hornbill Docs content really depends on the writer's goal, but in general Hornbill Docs content should stick with Descriptive, Expository, Conversational and Technical styles, ideally from the [Corporate First Person](#perspective-writing-corporate-first-person) or [Impersonal Writing](#perspective-writing-impersonal) perspectives.

A consistent and appropriate writing style helps ensure that the message is effectively communicated and well-received by the intended audience.

## Perspective Writing - Corporate First Person
When writing in the 1st person style as a company and not an individual, it is often referred to as the "corporate first person" or "organizational first person." In this style, the company speaks as a single entity using pronouns like "we," "us," and "our" to refer to itself. This approach helps establish a more personal and engaging tone while maintaining the company's unified voice. It is commonly used in marketing materials, corporate communications, product documentation and other business-related content.

## Perspective Writing - Impersonal
When a text is not written in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person, it is typically written in the impersonal style. Impersonal writing does not focus on a specific person or group and avoids using pronouns like "I," "you," or "he/she/they." Instead, it focuses on the subject matter or general information without referring to a specific individual or entity. This style is common in academic writing, scientific papers, and formal reports, where the emphasis is placed on the information being presented rather than the person presenting it.
