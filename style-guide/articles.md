<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Ensure that definite and indefinite articles are included, applying them accurately throughout the content. Use *a*, *an*, and *the* in your writing for ease of comprehension and translation.

The terms *a* and *an* function as indefinite articles preceding a singular noun. They denote any unspecified member within a group.

Meanwhile, *the* is a definite article applied before singular and plural nouns. It specifies one or more specific members within a group.

Select the indefinite article *a* or *an* based on the pronunciation of an abbreviation, word, or number. Use *a* before those starting with a consonant sound and *an* before those beginning with a vowel sound.

When an abbreviation is vocalized letter by letter, select the article based on the sound of the first letter. If the abbreviation is spoken as a word, choose the article according to its pronunciation.

For file name extensions that begin with a period, like `.exe`, consider pronouncing the period as *dot* and utilize the indefinite article *a*.
