<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

This document is an essential reference for all contributors to Hornbill's documentation. Its goal is to ensure clarity, consistency, and legal compliance in how we refer to our products and those not developed by Hornbill. We aim to maintain the highest quality standard across our documentation while respecting trademark laws and usage guidelines for external products. By following the directives outlined here, contributors will be equipped to present product names accurately, reinforcing our commitment to professionalism and respect for intellectual property. Whether you are writing about our in-house solutions or referencing third-party tools, this guide will provide the necessary instructions to do so correctly and effectively.

## General guidelines

The following general guidelines outline the recommended approach for referencing product names within Hornbill's documentation. They provide specific recommendations for both our products and those developed externally. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency and upholds best practices across all our materials.

Follow these guidelines for writing Hornbill product names:

- Do not abbreviate Hornbill product names.

- Do not use *'s* to show the possessive form of our product names. Instead, revise your writing to use a prepositional phrase.

  To see examples of this guideline, see "[Apostrophes in possessives](/style-guide/apostrophes#apostrophes-in-possessives)" and "[Prepositions](/style-guide/prepositions)."

Follow these guidelines for writing non-Hornbill product names, brand names, or company names:

- Always use the product name's official spelling and capitalization. Avoid altering or abbreviating the name unless officially recognized by the brand.

  **Example:** Use *Adobe Photoshop* instead of *adobe photoshop* or *Photoshop*.

- When a product name starts with a lowercase letter, maintain its lowercase formatting even when it appears at the beginning of a sentence. But whenever feasible, restructure the sentence to prevent starting it with a lowercase word.

  **Example (avoid) ❌**
    - eBay offers a wide range of products.

  **Example (prefer) ✅**
    - A wide range of products is offered on eBay.

- Refrain from using product names in a verb form to maintain their integrity as proper nouns and respect trademark laws.

  **Example:** Instead of saying "You can Photoshop the image," say "You can edit the image using Adobe Photoshop."

- Only use shortened or abbreviated product names if they are officially recognized and widely understood abbreviations. Clearly define any approved abbreviations at the first mention in a document.

  **Example:** *Adobe Photoshop* can be abbreviated to *Photoshop* if it is the accepted norm within the company and audience.

- When a product name is used for the first time in a document, include the appropriate trademark symbol (™ or ®) if applicable, following the company's trademark usage guidelines.

   **Example:** *Adobe Photoshop®* is a leading software for image editing.

- Ensure clarity between product names and general terms or functionalities, especially when a product name could also describe a feature or action.

  **Example:** Distinguish between "Google search functionality" (feature) and "Google® Search" (product).

- When discussing features or capabilities specific to a version or edition of a product, clearly specify the version or edition name.

   **Example:** *Adobe Photoshop CC 2020* introduces enhanced cloud document access and improved preset workflows not found in *Adobe Photoshop CC 2019*.

- Do not modify product names with playful or creative alterations that could dilute the brand identity or confuse the audience.

   **Example:** Avoid using *Photoshop Extravaganza* in place of *Adobe Photoshop*.

- Strive for uniformity in how product names are presented across all types of documentation and writing deliverables to reinforce brand recognition and ensure clarity for the audience.

## Feature names

A *feature* refers to a unique attribute or functionality within a product, often highlighted by its capabilities within that product. Typically, feature names are written in lowercase, though exceptions exist.

In writing documentation, refrain from capitalizing a feature name unless it is officially treated with capitalization. Should there be any uncertainty, adhere to the capitalization used in existing documents that mention the feature. Similarly, when referencing a UI label, ensure the capitalization aligns with that displayed in the user interface.

For example, "quick sync" is a general feature of a specific product. Write it in lowercase unless "Quick Sync" is the official name in the product documentation or UI.

**Example (incorrect) ❌**
  - The Quick Sync feature allows for faster data transfer.

**Example (correct) ✅**
  - The quick sync feature allows for faster data transfer.

However, write the feature name as is for an officially capitalized feature that is documented or appears in a UI.

**Example (incorrect) ❌**
  - You can customize your settings in the privacy center.

**Example (correct) ✅**
  - You can customize your settings in the Privacy Center

### Shortening or abbreviating Hornbill product names

When discussing a Hornbill product, you might find occasions where shortening the product name feels more natural. For instance, rather than always saying "Hornbill Product A," referring to it simply as "Product A" could be more convenient in specific contexts.

Always use the complete trademarked product name. Avoid abbreviating product names unless you are aligning with a UI label. In these situations, ensure it is clear that you are referencing the Hornbill product and not another item with a similar name.
