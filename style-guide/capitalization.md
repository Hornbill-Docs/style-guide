# Capitalization

Generally, use a lowercase style in text and sentence-style capitalization for headings. Additionally, do the following:
- Do not capitalize words unless necessary. Consider why and if it truly needs to be capitalized before doing so.
- Do not use all-uppercase text unless within specific contexts: official names, constant abbreviations in all-caps, or references to code that necessitates an all-uppercase format.
- Do not use camel case, except in authorized names or when referring to code that specifically employs camel case.

## Capitalization styles

In technical writing, various elements like headings, captions, labels, and interface components typically adhere to either *sentence-style capitalization* or *headline-style capitalization*.

**Sentence-style capitalization:** Primarily lowercase, it capitalizes only the initial letter of the first word in a sentence and any others that necessitate capitalization, such as proper nouns. Proper nouns encompass specific names of individuals, locations, businesses, languages, protocols, and products.

**Examples of sentence-style capitalization**
- User authentication
- Artificial intelligence in healthcare
- Crafting complex SQL queries
- Properties and settings for exporting
- Requirements for Linux and UNIX operating systems

**Headline-style capitalization:** This style employs beginning each significant word with an uppercase letter in the text.

In headline-style capitalization, capitalize the initial letter of the following words:
- The first and last words of the text
- All nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions such as *after*, *although*, *because*, *before*, *how*, *if*, *than*, *that*, *though*, *until*, *when*, *where*, *whether*, and *while*
- Any word in a hyphenated compound that is not an article, preposition, or coordinating conjunction
- The last word in a hyphenated compound, regardless of its part of speech

In headline-style capitalization, do not capitalize the initial letter of the following words:
- Articles, except as the first word
- Coordinating conjunctions
- Prepositions, except as the first or last word
- The *to* in an infinitive

**Examples of headline-style capitalization**
- Best Practices for Mobile App Development
- Optimizing Search Engine Performance with Advanced Algorithms
- Exploring the Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

## Capitalization and abbreviations

Verify the capitalization of the spelled-out form of an abbreviation. Note that many spelled-out abbreviations do not require initial uppercase letters.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- graphical user interface (GUI)
- local area network (LAN)
- service-oriented architecture (SOA)

The majority of expanded language and protocol names typically begin with capital letters.

**Examples**
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
- Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
- What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)

When you spell out an abbreviation, avoid capitalizing mid-word letters to indicate the origin of an initialism.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- eXtensible markup language (XML)

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- Extensible Markup Language (XML)

## Capitalization and colons

In general, use a lowercase letter on the text that immediately follows a colon.

**Examples**
- Three security measures are evaluated: a firewall, an encryption key, and a password.
- Executing a DROP TABLE statement is final: you cannot restore a table after you drop it.

Use an uppercase letter on the text that immediately follows a colon when the text is one of the following items:
- Item in a vertical list
- Note that follows a label
- Proper noun
- Quotation
- Subheading on the same line as a heading

**Examples**
- Consider the following factors before upgrading your server machine:
  - Cost
  - Performance
  - Scalability
- **Warning:** Updating your operating system to its latest version requires a reboot.
- The text editor supports syntax highlighting for these programming languages: Ruby, Python, and Perl.
- One famous quote by Pablo Picasso is: "Good artists copy, great artists steal."
- Input/output operations: Move mode and locate mode

## Capitalization and figures

Use sentence-style capitalization for figure captions and for callouts in figures and illustrations.

## Capitalization in general text

As much as possible, use a lowercase style in running text, and apply the following capitalization guidelines:
- Use lowercase for names and terms unless the name or term is a proper noun. Translators are wary of translating terms that have initial uppercase letters. In general, if a term should be translated, use lowercase.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - The company is hiring Graphic Designers.
    - Execute the Migration.
    - To illustrate the concept, create a Class diagram.
  
  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - The company is hiring graphic designers.
    - Execute the migration.
    - To illustrate the concept, create a class diagram.

- Do not use uppercase letters for emphasis. Consider using a note with a meaningful label to call attention to essential hints, tips, guidance, restrictions, or advice that might be overlooked.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Do NOT delete the differential database backups.
    - The configuration that you specified is VERY important.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - **Critical:** Do not delete the differential database backups.
    - The configuration that you specified is very important.

- Do not create terms with internal uppercase letters.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - StorageGroup

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - storage group

- Do not start a sentence with a lowercase term; rewrite the sentence.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - `onmouseover` events can add visual interest.
    - `if` expressions, unlike `if` statements, return a value.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - You can add visual interest by using `onmouseover` events.
    - Unlike `if` statements, `if` expressions return a value.

- Do not capitalize the names of features and components unless they are sold separately or are trademarked.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Read more about Database Replication to ...
    - Leverage Stored Procedures instead of plain SQL statements for better performance.

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - Read more about database replication to ...
    - Leverage stored procedures instead of plain SQL statements for better performance.

- Do not capitalize collective or generic terms, such as agent names.
  
  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - The Heap Manager
    - The Paging Supervisor
    - The Virtual Machines

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - The heap manager
    - The paging supervisor
    - The virtual machines

## Capitalization in glossaries and indexes

Use lowercase for glossary and index terms unless a term is a proper noun or requires capitalization for other reasons.

Use sentence-style capitalization for glossary definitions.

## Capitalization in headings and titles

In general, use sentence-style capitalization for headings.

Use sentence-style capitalization for these items:
- Headings in books (except the book title)
- Topic titles and headings in information centres
- Titles and headings in online information, such as tutorials, samples, technotes, and websites
- Titles of white papers and marketing content

Use headline-style capitalization for these items:
- Titles of books
- Titles of CDs
- Titles of stand-alone information units, such as information centres, quick start guides, and courses

If a headline-style title has a subtitle, apply these capitalization guidelines:
- Use headline-style capitalization for a subtitle that is displayed on the same line as the title, is short, or is essential to the title.
- Use sentence-style capitalization for a subtitle that is displayed separately from the title, is lengthy, or is supplementary to the title.

When you cite a heading in text, use the capitalization used in the source unless the original heading is in all uppercase letters. In that case, use headline-style capitalization in the citation.

## Capitalization and hyphenated words

Use the ensuing rules for capitalizing hyphenated words:
- If a hyphenated word starts at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of a heading with sentence-style capitalization, capitalize the first element only, unless the following element is a proper noun or adjective.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Post-Processing methods enhance image quality.
    - All-american manufacturing is less common than it used to be.
    - Open-Source graphics software
    - Non-European-Based companies

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - Post-processing methods enhance image quality.
    - All-American manufacturing is less common than it used to be.
    - Open-source graphics software
    - Non-European-based companies

- If a hyphenated word starts at the beginning of a heading with headline-style capitalization, capitalize the first element in the word; the last element in the word, regardless of its part of speech; and any element that is not an article, preposition, or coordinating conjunction.

  **Examples (incorrect) ❌**
    - Self-contained Sensors
    - Once-a-day Notifications
    - Designing Interfaces for Non-English-speaking Users

  **Examples (correct) ✅**
    - Self-Contained Sensors
    - Once-a-Day Notifications
    - Designing Interfaces for Non-English-Speaking Users

## Capitalization of letters as letters

When referring to a specific letter within a word, employ the same capitalization as the letter in the word itself. This approach ensures consistency and avoids any potential ambiguity. For example, if you refer to a letter in the middle of a word, use the capitalization that occurs in the middle of the word.

**Examples**
- To form the plural of a single letter, add an apostrophe and the letter *s*.
- The *M* in *RDBMS* stands for *Management*.
- Double the letter *s* in the word *accessibility*.
- Before the repair, the printer did not print uppercase *A*'s or lowercase *t*'s.

When referencing a letter and its capitalization is irrelevant, use uppercase.

**Examples**
- Beginner typists often mistype *P*'s and *Z*'s.
- With some fonts, readers can mistake *N*'s for *M*'s.

## Capitalization in lists

Capitalize the first word of each item in a vertical list.

**Example**
  - The following are key software technologies used in modern businesses:
    - Cloud-based storage solutions
    - Artificial intelligence algorithms
    - Internet of Things devices

In definition lists, capitalize the first word of each term or descriptive name, unless it must be lowercase, and capitalize the first word of each definition.

**Example**  
**Create**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to add or insert new data into a system or database.

**Read**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capability to retrieve or access existing data from a system or database.

**Update**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capacity to modify or alter existing data within a system or database.

**Delete**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function to remove or eliminate data from a system or database.

## Capitalization for tables in text

Use sentence-style capitalization for these table elements:
  - Cell contents
  - Column headings
  - Row labels
  - Table captions

## Special capitalization style names

Avoid using specific naming conventions like *camel case* or *snake case* to describe casing styles. These terms lack universality in localization and lack standardization. Instead, explain what the requirements are and provide an example.

**Example**
- Name your table columns similar to how you name databases and tables. Use lowercase letters and replace spaces with underscores for names exceeding one word. Some examples are `first_name`, `employee_id`, or `gender`.
