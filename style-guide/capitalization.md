# Capitalization

Generally, use a lowercase style in text and sentence-style capitalization for headings. Additionally, do the following:

- Do not capitalize words unless necessary. Consider why and if it truly needs to be capitalized before doing so.
- Do not use all-uppercase text unless within specific contexts: official names, constant abbreviations in all-caps, or references to code that necessitates an all-uppercase format.
- Do not use camel case, except in authorized names or when referring to code that specifically employs camel case.

## Capitalization styles
In technical writing, various elements like headings, captions, labels, and interface components typically adhere to either *sentence-style capitalization* or *headline-style capitalization*.
