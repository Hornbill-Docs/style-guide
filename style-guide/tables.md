# Tables

<code>ELMER: Work In Progress</code>

Use tables to provide a structured and efficient way of presenting complex data clearly and concisely. The effective use of tables enhances readability, aids comprehension, and allows for quick comparison and analysis of information.

## Table or list?

Tables are often the ideal choice for presenting sets of related data. Yet, in some situations, a list may be more practical. The following table serves as a guide to help you decide between using a table or a list:

| Item type | Example | How to present |
|---|---|---|
| Each item is a single unit. | A list of programming language names, or a list of steps to follow. | Use a numbered list, lettered list, or bulleted list. |
| Each item is a pair of pieces of related data. | A list of term and definition pairs. | Use a description list (or, in some contexts, a table). |
| Each item is three or more pieces of related data. | A set of parameters, where each parameter has a name, a data type, and a description. | Use a table. |

### When not to use tables

To ensure tables are used effectively and only when necessary, here are key scenarios where their use should be avoided or carefully considered:

1. Avoid using tables for presenting lengthy one-dimensional lists across multiple columns. For example, if you're dealing with a long list of function names, avoid splitting the list into two halves and presenting these halves in a two-column table format just for the sake of saving space. Reserve tables for two-dimensional data, where the information logically and semantically fits into a row and column structure.

2. Typically, a single row of content does not warrant the use of a table; however, in certain scenarios, such as maintaining consistent layout in reference documentation, a table format may be appropriate.

3. Convert tables with a single column into a list format for better clarity and readability.

4. Avoid embedding tables within a numbered procedure; place them either before or after the sequence for better flow and comprehension.

5. Minimize the use of tables for document layout or for presenting information that can be more effectively communicated through other formatting methods. If your authoring tool supports specific markups or HTML elements for certain types of content, use them. For instance, instead of styling tables to display notes, notices, or code snippets, opt for the alternative formatting options provided by your tool for these elements.
