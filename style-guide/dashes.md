# Dashes

<code>ELMER: Complete </code>

Do not use en dashes or em dashes in technical information.

## En dashes

En dashes (–) are longer than hyphens (-) and shorter than em dashes (—). Most keyboards do not have a key for an en dash.

Do not use en dashes; use hyphens instead.

**Examples (en dashes)**
  - letters S–Z
  - numbers 1–8
  - Estimate an allowance of 2.50–3.50 in. (63.5–88.9 mm).

**Examples (hyphens)**
  - letters S-Z
  - numbers 1-8
  - Estimate an allowance of 2.50-3.50 in. (63.5-88.9 mm).

## Em dashes

Em dashes are longer than both hyphens and en dashes. Most keyboards do not have a key for an em dash, but many authoring tools provide a symbol for an em dash, and some authoring tools create an em dash if you type two hyphens together.

Do not use em dashes in technical information. Rewrite the text or use common punctuation marks such as commas, parentheses, or a colon to achieve the same result.
