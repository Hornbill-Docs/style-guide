# Parentheses

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

Use parentheses to specify elements like abbreviations, symbols, and measurements. However, refrain from incorporating parentheses in continuous text.

## Parentheses with abbreviations, symbols, and measurements

When detailing the complete form of an abbreviation, punctuation mark, or special character, follow it with the respective abbreviation, mark, or character enclosed in parentheses. Similarly, when stating a measurement, append its equivalent in a different measurement system, enclosed in parentheses, immediately after the original value.

**Examples**
- HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard language for creating web pages.
- When editing text, use the ampersand symbol (&) to represent the word *and*.
- The recommended daily vitamin C intake is 75 milligrams (mg) for adults (about 0.0026 ounces).

## Parentheses to form plurals

Do not use the letter *s* in parentheses *(s)* to indicate that a noun can be singular or plural. Some languages form plural nouns differently than English, and the construction *(s)* can cause translation problems. Instead, use the plural form or, if it is important to indicate both singular and plural options, use the phrase *one or more*.

**Example (incorrect) ❌**
- The software can generate report(s) based on user input.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
- The software can generate reports based on user input.
- The software can generate one or more reports based on user input.

## Parentheses in running text

Avoid using parentheses in running text, as it diminishes the significance of the enclosed information. Prioritize including essential information and omitting non-essential details. Parentheses can disrupt the sentence flow, so consider rephrasing the text or using different punctuation. If parentheses are necessary, ensure the sentence remains grammatically and technically accurate even without the parenthetical content.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- The conference (held annually) attracts experts from various fields.

- The team developed an innovative approach involving the use of artificial intelligence to solve the problem.

If the parenthetical text is not a complete sentence, include the parenthetical text in the sentence to which it pertains. Do not use an initial uppercase letter on the first word unless otherwise required, and do not insert a period inside the parentheses.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
- Install the device drivers (Included in the product box).
- The meal options include vegetarian dishes (Like salads, soups, and pasta.)

**Examples (correct) ✅**

If the parenthetical text is a complete sentence, you can either include the parenthetical sentence in the sentence to which it pertains, or you can enclose it in parentheses as a separate sentence. If you include the parenthetical sentence in the sentence to which it pertains, do not use an initial uppercase letter on the first word or insert a period inside the parentheses. If the parenthetical text is a separate sentence, use an initial uppercase letter on the first word and insert the period inside the parentheses.
