# Procedures

<code>ELMER: Complete</code>

A procedure is a set of specific, ordered steps or instructions designed to accomplish a particular task or solve a specific problem.

Use numbered lists to describe tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. Follow these key guidelines when composing the steps for such procedures.

## Introducing the procedure

Use one of these methods to introduce a procedure:

- A lead-in sentence or infinitive phrase (one that starts with the word *To*)
- A heading such as "Procedure"
- A combination of a lead-in sentence or infinitive phrase with a heading such as "Procedure"

**Translation consideration:** To avoid translation problems, consider using a lead-in sentence instead of an infinitive phrase. Ensure you use only one method of introducing a procedure consistently throughout your library.


If you use a sentence to introduce a procedure, use a colon at the end of the lead-in sentence unless another sentence intervenes between the lead-in sentence and the procedure. If a sentence intervenes, use a period to end both the lead-in sentence and the intervening sentence. If you use an infinitive phrase to introduce a procedure, use a colon at the end of the phrase.

**Procedure**

To back up your important files efficiently:

1. Locate the documents on your computer.
2. Right-click on the folder and select **Copy**.
3. Paste the folder into your designated backup location.

Use a colon at the end of a sentence that introduces a subprocedure (nested ordered list) unless another sentence intervenes between the lead-in wording and the subprocedure. If a sentence intervenes, use a period to end both the lead-in sentence and the intervening sentence.

  a. Run the installer and select the language.<br>
  b. Agree to the terms and conditions.<br>
  c. Choose the installation directory.

## Writing steps

Compose each step to represent an important user action, but be cautious not to over-detail. For users beyond the beginner level, indicate sequences of menu selections using arrows. When instructing users to press Enter as part of an action, incorporate this directive within the same step, not as a standalone step. Exclude any ellipses, colons, or similar punctuation from interface element labels in your action descriptions.

**Examples (correct) ✅**

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**
1. Click **Open File...**.
2. Select a file in the dialog box and click **Open**.

**Examples (correct) ✅**
1. Click **Open File**.
2. Select a file in the dialog box and click **Open**.

Keep procedures concise and manageable by dividing them into smaller tasks. Ensure that procedural steps do not exceed two levels of depth; reorganize the content if necessary to maintain simplicity and clarity.

When a procedure comprises just a single step, present it as a sentence or a brief paragraph without assigning it a number.

Avoid using the term *please* in instructions. Politeness expressions are unnecessary, can set an inappropriate tone for technical content, and may not be interpreted uniformly across different cultures.

Use the imperative mood in the first sentence of each step. Should an explanation be required, include it within the same step following the imperative sentence rather than creating a new step. Rather than detailing the result of each action, guide the user in the subsequent step to the location or context where the action is to be performed.

**Examples (correct) ✅**

If you orient the user to the location where the action is performed or explain the purpose of the action, do so before describing the action.

If the procedure includes snippets of code as examples, place the code (or a link to the code if the code is in a separate topic) in the step it applies to. If the example of code applies to the whole task, place the code or link after the last step. Label the link to the code so that the purpose of the code is clear to users, for example, "Code for an SQL table."

## Indicating optional and conditional steps

If a step is optional, begin the step with the word *Optional*. If your authoring tool provides a semantic element to generate the word *Optional*, use that element.

**Example**
  1. Optional: Click **Subscribe**. In the **Email** field, type your email address.

If a step is conditional, state the condition or begin the step with an *if* clause.

**Examples**
  1. For files exceeding 100 MB only: use the **Large File Upload** option in the **File** menu.

<!-- added a <span> tag to discontinue or restart the numbering of an ordered list -->
<span></span>

  1. If you have administrator privileges, go to the **Settings** menu and select **Advanced Options**.

## Handling nonsequential actions

Do not use sequential steps for actions that do not follow a specific order. In cases where a procedure involves mutually exclusive choices or branching conditions, avoid listing these alternatives as sequential steps. Instead, explain the condition within a single step and use an unordered list to detail the different options. Refrain from using the word *or* to separate these alternatives.

**Examples (incorrect) ❌**

## Ending the procedure

Do not include actions outside the procedure's scope, and refrain from integrating steps from a different procedure. Should a follow-up procedure be required, guide the user toward it through a cross-reference or a hyperlink at the end of the current procedure. Alternatively, mention additional procedures in a subsequent paragraph or provide a link. Avoid concluding a procedure with a statement solely indicating its completion.
