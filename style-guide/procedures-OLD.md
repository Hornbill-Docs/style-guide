# Procedures
As a content writer, you will be writing procedures for many Hornbill Products and Services. On of the key elements of writing procedures is using the UI to the fullest advantage to explain the procedure. There are some complex procedures that you may need to understand and then write in a simplified manner. Some of the guidelines that form the best approach to writing procedures are as follows:
* Always break the procedure into steps and then write step-by-step instructions for each task to be performed. 
* Use UI interface elements like icons, buttons, etc. for visual representation and easy understanding of the procedure.
* Format the text as per the conventions required for procedures. For example, the UI elements like buttons names must be bold.
* Write your steps based on the device that will be used by the customer. In today world, most customers view an application on both laptops and phones. If your product is compatible with multiple input devices, then the steps for each device must be written separately. For example, the steps for a laptop and phone may change as follows:

    |Laptop|Phone|
    |:---|:---|
    |Click the **Login** button.|Tap the **Login** button.|
    |Click the Down arrow key to scroll down|Swipe to scroll down.|
